# ObjectOrientedProgramming

## Description

This repository contains projects created while learning object-oriented programming in Java. The main goal is to understand core OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

Additionally, the repository includes implementations of selected **design patterns**, which are an essential part of building scalable and maintainable software architecture.

## Technologies

- Java  
- IntelliJ IDEA  
- Git  

## Implemented Design Patterns

- **Strategy:** Allows defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable at runtime.
- **Decorator:** Enables dynamic extension of an object's functionality without modifying its original code.

## Key Concepts

- Object-oriented programming (OOP)  
- SOLID principles  
- Design patterns  
- Clean code practices
